# EthnicValueSegregation

Providing reproducible simulations and analysis for the paper "How different homophily preferences mitigate and spur ethnic and value segregation: Schelling's model extended" (2018)
Rocco Paolillo, Jan Lorenz

## Reproduce single simulation runs

Use the NetLogo model (EthnicValueSegregation.nlogo). 

It should prefereable be run in NetLogo 6.0.4. (Download free https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
It also runs in NetLogoWeb (slightly slower) in the browser. Try this link:

## Reproduce the datasets

Run the two already configured BehaviorSpace experiments in the NetLogo model (EthnicValueSegregation.nlogo). These will reproduce files as EthnicValueSegregation Extension-table.csv and EthnicValueSegregation Original_Schelling-table.csv. Results will differ only minimally because of random fluctuation.
